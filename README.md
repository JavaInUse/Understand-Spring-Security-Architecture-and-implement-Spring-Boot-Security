In this tutorial we will be looking at how Spring Security works and its architecture. We will be creating a Spring Boot Project to expose two REST API's
<ul type="disc">
<li>
  /helloadmin</li><li>
  /hellouser</li>
  </ul>
  
We will then be implementing Spring Security such that a client having Admin role will be able to access both /helloadmin and /hellouser API. While a client having User role will be able to access only /hellouser API
